## working with debian
This section is about installing debian for the first time, and/or solving some
issues about it.
#### Installation.
First thing you need to do is download any of iso images to start your machine
with the instalation of debian. I recomend for now `net-install'. It has the
basic system enough to start the instalation. In it, you can choose later one
or more servers from where to download the rest of the packages, from a list of
repositories all arround the world. [Visit debian download
page](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/debian-installer/)

You can burn the image into a cd, or you can put it on an usb stick. There are
many tutorials to learn how to do this, but in fact, and for new linux users,
maybe "[linux live usb creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com/)" is a very good
option. Normally, new linux users come from window$, so, this program runs on
it. What this program does, is pick up an iso image of any linux distro, an
puts it on a usb stick, making it bootable.
