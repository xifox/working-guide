## working with debian
This section is about installing debian for the first time, and/or solving some issues about it.
#### Installation.
First thing you need to do is download any of iso images to start your machine with the instalation of debian. I recomendo for now `net-install'. It has the basic system enough to start the instalation. In it, you can choose later one or more servers from where to download the rest of the packages, from a list of repositories.
You can burn the image into a cd, or you can put it on an usb stick. There are many tutorials to learn how to do this, but in fact, and for new linux users, maybe "[linux live usb creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com/)" is a very good option.
